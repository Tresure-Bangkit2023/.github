# Tresure: Your Trip Pleasure
Traveling is an essential part of people's lives. However, planning a trip can be a daunting task, especially when it comes to managing expenses. Naturally, we want to enjoy our holiday without having to stress about money. However, we were still unsure of where to go given our budget. This is where the need for a travel planner application arises, one that can help users plan their trips according to their budget. Our business plan aims to develop travel recommendations that can help improve the efficiency and experience of our customers' vacations.

According to American Psychological Association research, 61% of respondents said they experienced stress throughout the holiday season. Some of the main causes of stress were time limits, an urgent list of must-see and must-do activities (67%), and a shortage of funds (62%). We seek to develop ideas and suggestions for locations to visit when we have a tight budget in order to aid ourselves and the community in making the most of the vacation experience.

## Background Idea
Our team wanted to produce the “Tresure” app by first conducting research to identify the problems faced by potential users. After that, we developed the app, focusing on improving the user experience when planning a vacation using AI. We make sure that our app can help users find vacation packages that suit their budget and preferences. During the development process, we’d also test the app to ensure its quality and security.
